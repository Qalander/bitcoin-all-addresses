thank you, blockchair team!

dump files from blockchair (4210 files) from 20090103 to 20200718

checksum of dump files from blockchair is available.

address list is split in 262 files (xaa to xkb) totalling approximately 24.58GB (if you `git clone` the repo, it is larger than that).

one feature of my lists is i kept the order of addresses in which they first appeared in blockchair dumps.

addresses total: 1483853800

unique addresses total: 692773144

unique addresses 1*: 470763465

unique addresses 3*: 167765027

general methodology:

1.download all output dump files from blockchair, see example script `blockchair.btcoutputs.sh` ;


1.1.check the smallest file sizes to be sure those files downloaded correctly;

OBS: make sure files are processed in the correct date order in all steps required!

1.2.also test .gz files:

    gunzip -t [*.gz]

2.uncompress files and cut the 7th field (recipient); see also script `blockchair.btcoutputs.addrgrep.sh` :

    for f in *.tsv.gz ;do gunzip -c "$f" | cut -d$'\t' -f7 > "${f}.addr.txt" ;done

3.concatenate resulting files in the original order;

4.number lines:

    nl concat.txt  > concatnl.txt

4.sort and output unique addresses only from the previous concatenated file; set large temporary diretory for buffers and LC_ALL to C (faster):

    export TMPDIR="$PWD"
    export LC_ALL=C
    sort -k2 -u -o concatnl.uniq.txt concatnl.txt

5.rearrange into the original order and cut only the address field (also export $TMPDIR and $LC_ALL):

    sort -n concatnl.uniq.txt | cut -f2 > final.txt

6.split resulting file at about 94MB to upload to github:

    split -C 94000000 final.txt
