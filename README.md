thank you, blockchair team!

dump files from blockchair (4210 files):

from 20090103 to 20200718

checksum of dump files from blockchair is available.

unique addresses total: 692773144

unique addresses 1*: ?

unique addresses 3*: ?

unique addresses bc*: ?

unique addresses *-*: ?

general methodology:

1.download all output dump files from blockchair;

1.1.check the smallest file sizes to be sure those files downloaded correctly;

1.2.also test .gz files:

    gunzip -t [*.gz]

2.uncompress files and cut the 7th field (recipient):

    for f in *.tsv.gz ;do gunzip -c "$f" | cut -d$'\t' -f7 > "${f}.addr.txt" ;done

3.concatenate resulting files in the original order;

4.number lines:

    nl concat.txt  > concatnl.txt

4.sort and output unique addresses only from the previous concatenated file; set large temporary diretory for buffers and LC_ALL to C (faster):

    TMPDIR="$PWD" LC_ALL=C sort -k2 -u -o concatnl.uniq.txt concatnl.txt

5.rearrange into the original order and cut only the address field (also set temp dir and LC_ALL):

    sort -n concatnl.uniq.txt | cut -f2 > final.txt

6.split resulting file at about 94MB to upload to github:

    split -C 94000000 final.txt


	Please consider giving me a nickle!  =)
